### First, make sure you have a Next.js app set up. If you haven't created one yet, you can use the following command to create a new Next.js app

```md
npx create-next-app my-app

```

### Once your Next.js app is set up, navigate to the root directory of your project

### Create a new folder called data in the root directory of your project. This is where you'll store your JSON file

### Place your JSON file inside the data folder. For example, let's say you have a file called data.json, the path would be ./data/data.json

### Now, you can read the JSON file in your Next.js app. Create a new file, such as DataPage.js, in the pages folder of your project

### Inside DataPage.js, import the JSON file using the relative path

```
import data from '../data/data.json';
```

### You can now use the data object to access the contents of the JSON file within your component. For example, you can map over an array of objects in the JSON file and render them

```mport data from '../data/data.json';

const DataPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>
          <h2>{item.title}</h2>
          <p>{item.description}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataPage;

```

### Finally, you can navigate to the URL corresponding to the DataPage component to see the JSON data rendered in your Next.js app

### Remember to adjust the file paths and JSON structure according to your specific use case

# That's it! You have successfully read a JSON file in a Next.js app using React.js
